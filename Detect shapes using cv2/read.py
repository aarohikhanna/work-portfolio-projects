# # Steps: 

# # 1;
# Show the image of the input and wait for user to hit the Key
# Then convert the image to grayscale
# Detect the edges to find contours
# Calculate the number of lines in contours using cv2.approxPolyDP() and letâ€™s detect shapes using cv2
# On the basis of no of lines determine the shape : if its 3 then its a triangle etc.
